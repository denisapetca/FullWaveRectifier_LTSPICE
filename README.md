# FullWaveRectifier_LTSPICE
LTSpice & Practical Implementation

This project consists of five stages, the design and simulation of a full-wave rectifier in LTSpice and its practical implementation. The system features a low-pass filter at the input, a V-V KHN topology using three operational amplifiers, and a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with switches in the signal path for series connection. The rectifier ensures dual-alternance signal processing. The project covers both circuit modeling in LTSpice and real-world hardware implementation.
